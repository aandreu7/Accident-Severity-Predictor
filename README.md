# Accident-Severity-Predictor
This project tries to find the best model to predict the severity of a traffic accident based on several variables such as location, road surface condition, speed limit, weather conditions, etc. The objective is to try to minimize the most severe accidents, and also respond to them as effectively and quickly as possible.
