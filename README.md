# Traffic Accident Severity Prediction

## Overview  
This project aims to find the best model to predict the severity of a traffic accident based on several variables such as location, road surface condition, speed limit, weather conditions, and more. The goal is to minimize the occurrence of the most severe accidents and improve response efficiency.  

## Features  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Uses **Random Forest** and **Neural Networks** to predict accident severity.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Data preprocessing, handling missing values, and feature selection.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing models for best performance.  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Performance measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

## Dataset  
The dataset is fully accessible on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/code/xavierberge/excel-dashbaord-road-accidents-analysis.
The dataset includes variables such as:  
- **Location:** Latitude and longitude of the accident.  
- **Road Surface Condition:** Dry, wet, icy, etc.  
- **Speed Limit:** The legal speed at the accident site.  
- **Weather Conditions:** Rain, fog, snow, etc.  
- **Time of Day:** Day or night impact analysis.
To process data, a United Kingdom dataset, which includes names of cities, important places, towns, etc, has been used. Data can be downloaded here: https://download.geonames.org/export/dump/GB.zip

## Results  
The performance of the models is evaluated using key metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**. Below is a comparison of the results:  

| Model           | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|----------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Random Forest  | XX%      | XX%       | XX%    | XX%      |
| Neural Network | XX%      | XX%       | XX%    | XX%      |

Further tuning and additional features may improve these results.
